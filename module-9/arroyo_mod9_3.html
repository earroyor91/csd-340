        <h1>Assignment 9.3: JavaScript - Part 1</h1>

        <p>Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth, upon this continent, 
            a new nation, conceived in <span id="liberty">______</span>, and dedicated to the proposition that all 
            men are created equal.</p>

        <p>Now we are engaged in a great <span id="civil">______</span> war, testing whether that nation, or any 
            nation so conceived, and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great 
            battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as 
            a final resting place for those who here gave their lives, that that nation might 
            live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.</p>

        <p>But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate, we can not consecrate -- we can not hallow -- this ground. 
            The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it far above our poor power to add 
            or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what 
            they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who 
            fought here, have, thus far, so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task 
            remaining before us -- that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they 
            gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in 
            vain -- that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of <span id="freedom">______</span> -- and that 
            government of the people, by the people, for the <span id="people">______</span>, shall not perish from the earth.</p>
