            <h2>Chapter 1 - About Me</h2>

            <p class="intro">My name is Edgar Arroyo. I grew up and currently live in the Los Angeles area in California. I live in the outskirts of LA,
                so it is nice and quiet where I am from.</p>

            <p>I grew up with 2 sisters and 1 brother. I am the oldest of the children. After me is a sister, after her is another sister,
                and my brother is the youngest.</p>

            <p><span class="sentence">My hobbies include fishing, weightlifting, and retro video game and console collecting.</span> I enjoy both freshwater and saltwater fishing.
                I mostly collect retro Nintendo games and handheld consoles.</p>

            <p>I currently work as an Electronics Technician. I am hoping to get a job in the software development industry upon completion of this
                program. The languages I have really enjoyed learning so far have been Python and SQL.
            </p>
